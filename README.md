# Gemini Curiosity Catalyst: Conceptual Pseudo-Code

## Overview
This repository contains conceptual pseudo-code illustrating the "Gemini Curiosity Catalyst," a proposed plugin for large language models like Gemini AI. The aim is to simulate an intrinsic drive for learning, enabling AI to proactively seek novel information, particularly concerning underrepresented linguistic and cultural contexts.

## Purpose
This code serves as a research prototype to demonstrate the functional architecture of an AI curiosity module. It is designed to inspire further research and development in autonomous AI learning and to highlight the potential for AI to bridge global knowledge and communication gaps.

## Components
The `curiosity_catalyst.py` script conceptualizes four main components:
1.  **Novelty Detection Engine:** Identifies knowledge gaps within the AI's understanding.
2.  **Exploration Policy Generator:** Decides what and how to learn by formulating external queries.
3.  **Intrinsic Reward System:** Reinforces successful learning outcomes based on information gain.
4.  **Linguistic & Cultural Prioritizer:** Focuses exploration on diverse and under-resourced linguistic/cultural data.

## How it Works (Conceptual)
The `curiosity_catalyst.py` script simulates the following flow for a given user prompt:
1.  **Initial Response:** A mocked Gemini AI provides an initial response, along with an inferred confidence level and a "knowledge density" score for the topic/language.
2.  **Novelty Detection:** The `Novelty Detection Engine` assesses if a significant knowledge gap exists (e.g., if confidence is low or knowledge density is sparse, as would be the case for less-common languages like Ekegusii).
3.  **Exploration:** If novelty is detected, the `Exploration Policy Generator` formulates and executes (mocked) external searches (e.g., Google Search, YouTube) to gather additional context.
4.  **Refinement:** The retrieved external information is then used to "refine" the original prompt, and the mocked Gemini AI is queried again with this augmented context.
5.  **Reward:** The `Intrinsic Reward System` calculates a reward based on the improvement in the AI's confidence in its refined response. This reward conceptually influences the `Exploration Policy` for future learning.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified simulation for conceptual demonstration purposes. Actual implementation would involve complex integration with real AI models and external APIs.

## Running the Code (Conceptual)
This code requires Python 3.x.
To run the conceptual demonstration:
```bash
python curiosity_catalyst.py
